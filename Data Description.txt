My capstone project involves finding out which 'barangay' (i.e. the smallest government unit) in Mandaluying City is closest to the one that my friend currently resides in at Quezon City. Using the coordinates data I will gather from geonames.org, I will extract the venues from the Foursquare API. This venue data will now describe the 'features' of each barangay within Mandaluyong City and QC and will be converted to indicator variables so I will be able to calculate a score to be used as basis for determining the similarities between barangays. Finally, I will use clustering to ascertain the similarities and trim-down options for my friend that will help his decision on where to move.
